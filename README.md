- 👋 Hi, I’m @LongThinhLe
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing and Robotic Arm Construction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ to build software for my Robotics Arm. In addition to C++, my strength in 3D modeling by SolidWorks will help the project happen soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who have a strong knowledge of Coding and Embedded Systems.
